                Since my first year of college, I have made it a priority to work on perfecting my craft of computer engineering outside of the classroom. The personal projects below were done in my free time, where I had to teach myself and learn through trial and error. Working on these projects has allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in my classes to the real world.

                    Ever since I was six, I have made it a priority to get good grades in school. I remember in kindergarden, I had the most hours of reading in the class's Books and Beyond program, and this earned me a lunch at McDonald's with the principle. Now that I am in college, I realize I have been given an education so I can offer a trade to the world. Learning only comes with struggle, and college has taught me how to keep working through difficult concepts and problems so that I can implement them in my future works.

                    When I am not in the classroom or coding on my computer, you can find me surfing at the beach or eating buffalo wings. I have lived in Carlsbad, California for my entire life with my parents and my two sisters. I played football for nine years and I am a huge NFL fan. Nothing makes me happier than sitting down on Sunday and checking my fantasy football lineups. Everyday I make it a priority to do something active so that I can stay in shape. In my free time, I also like to watch documentaries and read books. After college, I plan to stay up north and navigate through Silicon Valley during my 20's.

                Reading is a new hobby that I have picked up to fuel my hunger for perspective. As a young man entering the real world
                at the bottom of the totem pole, I am stiving to educate myself about life outside the classroom. I started to read daily during the 2019 summer, and I haven't slowed down since. I love improving my weaknesses through self-improvement books, but I also read fiction as well to decompress after a long day. Here are some books that I have recently read and what I took away from them.

                          This book was recommended to me by a coworker after an in-depth discussion about how society influences our behavior
                          patterns. In the beginning, a plane full of kids crashed on a deserted island, and the thought of no rules/parents was
                          very exciting to them at first. However, as their days continued with a lack of structure and order, the boys started to
                          turn on each other and become violent beasts. What I loved about this book is that it reminded me of my primal
                          instincts, which are often suppressed in today’s culture of America. This made me realize that I love sports so much
                          because it is the closest thing you can get to violent competition among men without the killing. I viewed society
                          around me as somewhat unnatural when I was reading, as we have set up this system with so much order that life is almost
                          too predictable. However, there are still things I can use my primal instincts for, such as working out and educating
                          myself in order to be better than the others around me.

                          Peterson is a speaker that I thoroughly enjoy listening on Podcasts, so I decided to read his book where he incorporated
                          a majority of his teachings. While reading this book, I would often come across an idea and stare at the ceiling for
                          five minutes as I reflected/processed it. One of my favorite points he brought up was that the Man had no conception of
                          time when we were first put on this planet, but we soon realized that there will be a future. This seems obvious,
                          however that is only because we are taught what "the future" is and that we know that we will be alive an hour from now.
                          That being said, the men that prepared for the future were the ones that became most successful. Men could have killed
                          their meat and eaten it all, but they realized that they could save it for later so that they do not have to go hunting
                          again. This concept is reflected in todays world if we observe work ethic of successful people. Those who suffer in the
                          present in order to be more prepared for the future are the most successful. I am going to college right now to spend
                          countless hours in the library, do thousands of practice problems, and go to lectures all because I am setting myself up
                          for the future. I was only subconsciously aware of this concept before I read this book, but now I am able to analyze my
                          everyday actions and make sure each of them has a purpose. Perterson had hundreds of other points just like this one
                          that I could write all day about.

                          Although this book was written close to a century ago, it is still considered one of the most intelligent books with
                          regards to how we as humans interact with each other. Everyone around us is interacting with each other, yet we do not
                          want to talk about why we act the way we act or what makes us awkward. Carnegie made me question my actions as I did
                          simple things such as going to work or ordering at a restaurant. My favorite point that he made in the books was that
                          there was absolutely no reason to ever talk poorly about someone behind their back. First of all, if you really have an
                          issue with somebody, confront them about it so that you can directly fix the problem. Then you will not have to worry
                          about the issue and it is resolved. Second of all, we as humans (including myself) tend to talk badly about people
                          because it makes us feel better about ourselves. If we have to exert our energy and time of day to hate on somebody,
                          then time is being wasted that could be going towards learning or improving ourselves. Third of all, you will just cause
                          more conflict if the person finds out you are talking behind their back and you look like a coward. We all have
                          experienced this type of situation. This realization has allowed me to have better relations with friends and coworkers
                          because I am able to carry myself with positive energy throughout my day and decrease the amount of drama in my life. I
                          have started to recognize that people just talk bad on others to boost their own ego because they are insecure. Again,
                          there were so many points made in this book that I could write all day long, but this is just one thing that has changed
                          how I go about my everyday life.

                          In this wonderful world of distractions, I have had trouble focusing on my work for long periods of time. The increased
                          amount of distractions in this world compared to when I was little is unbelievable. The internet can give me anything on
                          demand and i often find myself nose-deep in my phone. One of the most interesting points made in this book was the
                          concept of the Distraction Economy. The Distraction Economy involves companies making money simply off grabbing your
                          attention. YouTube and Snapchat do this by making highly addictive algorithms that keep users glued to their screens.
                          They throw in ads every once in a while, which generates revenue for them. In other words, people are taking your
                          attention and focus out of your day so that they can make money when you receive almost nothing of value in return.
                          Being able to put your attention towards the correct things is one of the most important skill you can have in this
                          current world. So many people cannot control their attention and are not living up to their greatest potential. I have
                          been inspired to flex my focus muscle by saying no to my brain when it wants to be interrupted by a distraction. After
                          frequently doing this, my brain has become nearly immune to getting distracted while everyone else is wasting their time
                          on “braindead” activities such as the YoutTube algorithm and Snapchat.

                          I was able to finish this book in a week by spending every spare second of my time reading it. Not only was this the
                          most engaging book I have ever read, but it had a huge effect on my mindset as I read. The author, David Goggin,
                          describes his life journey of transforming from a 300 pound man to a Navy Seal. He describes his mindset at every point
                          in his journey and how he overcame many obstacles. Goggins has an incredible amount of “want” and “heart.” The biggest
                          thing I took away from this book is that there are two voices in your head: the good and the bad. Sometimes one of them
                          will win, but you can fully suppress that bad voice in your head by focusing on what you are able to do in the present
                          moment. Tell that voice no. Focus on proving that voice wrong rather than other people. Life is a mental battle with
                          yourself constantly, and if you allow yourself to be lazy or give up, it will be a constant lifestyle that you adopt.
                          This has made me much more aware of how I think and has motivated me to keep grinding. My best friend Quinn and I live
                          by this way of life, where we are constantly hungry for self-improvement and success. We keep each other accountable and
                          make sure that we always have this mindset. This mindset has improved so many aspects of my life and has been building
                          me up into a prosperous young man.

                          I recently purchased an Arduino Uno kit and decided to read this book for an introduction. This book only took me about
                          five hours, but it was able to jumpstart me into the world of Arduino programming. I had never read a programming book
                          before, and it was surprisingly not dry at all. It had some awesome interactive projects that I was able to do along the
                          way which demonstrated the concepts that were discussed in each chapter. This hands-on characteristic of the book made
                          it much more engaging and allowed me to get a better visual representation of their code. The Aduino is coded in a
                          modified C programming language and it can be used to do all sorts of projects. As an engineer, it is my job to submit
                          an input into a device in order to obtain a desired output. Stacking these input/output combinations on top of each
                          other will eventually create a huge chain reaction, and a final product is developed. I am excited to experiment around
                          more with the Arduino and apply the concepts that I learned in this book.

                          In this old western novel, the two main characters, Gus and Call, travel across the United states to New Mexico. This
                          book is realistic fiction and takes place in the Cowboy era, where the Native Americans roamed throughout the country as
                          well. Gus and Call leave their small town with over 100 men and horses, and only about 10 of them survived. Many of the
                          men died on the hardest part of the journey, which was a long stretch of land that had no food, water, or trees. This
                          stretch was called the Dead Man’s Walk, which is where the title came from. This book was so fascinating because of the
                          historical accuracy that it portrayed. Buffalo Hump was the head of one of the bloodthirsty Native American Tribes, and
                          is actually a real person that lived during this time. The book went in depth about how the Indians would scalp their
                          enemies, and the spiritual thinking that they used to navigate the wild country. There are a couple more books in this
                          series and a television series to go along with it, so I am excited for them in the future.
